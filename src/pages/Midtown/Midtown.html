<p>We are happy to announce the introduction of the <strong>Midtown Trolley</strong>! This trolley will improve
	<em>walkability</em> and <em>reduce traffic</em> along the Providence Rd corridor. The trolley will run every ten
	minutes so you won't have to wait.</p>

<p>We encourage all visitors visiting Midtown Charlotte by car to park in the designated park-and-ride garage near
	Sharon Amity Rd and enjoy the free trolley service.</p>

<p>To pay for this project, we need to secure financing from multiple sources:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Local businesses</li>
	<li>City and neighborhood financing</li>
	<li>Federal matching grants</li>
</ul>
<p>To cover local obligations, we need to establish a Municipal Service District as prescribed under
	<a href="http://www.ncleg.net/EnactedLegislation/Statutes/PDF/ByArticle/Chapter_160A/Article_23.pdf"
