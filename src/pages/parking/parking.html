<h2>Parking</h2>
<p>To <em>improve walkability</em> and <em>ease traffic</em> within the SouthPark area, we are introducing a neighborhood-wide
	transportation plan utilizing <em>park-and-ride garages</em> at the main entry points to the area and <em>streetcars</em>
	to move people to their destination. Below is map of the park-and-ride garages and all streetcar stations.</p>
